# Deep Learning Projects
Here are some deep learning projects I implemented to learn more about the various use cases.

So far, I have explored: 
1) Basic ML models for linear classification
2) Multi-layer Neural Networks for image reconstruction
3) Training ResNet on rotated images and finetuning ResNet to classify those images
4) Recreating YOLO for object detection
5) Contructing cat images using Generative Adversarial Networks
6) Teaching an AI agent how to play Brick Breaker using Reinforcement Learning
